    <h1>FIRST WEEK AT AKIRACHIX</h1>
    <p>
        <img src="akirachix_logo.jpeg" alt="">
        On my first day of admission, I was warmly recieved by the AkiraChix alumnis. <br> 
        This promoted a feeling of togetherness and community. I got to meet my fellow students from some parts of Africa <br>
        Tanzania, Malawi, Rwanda and Uganda. The first week was a bit confusing since the environment was new. <br>
